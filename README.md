## Primary Tasks

- The current grid is implemented using some CSS applied using a class on a div in
  the traditional way (see App.js). The task requirement is to remove the current
  CSS implementation and build a reusable grid component to place it in the
  ‘layout’ folder with the other layout components.
  NOTE: The complexity of this component is up to you. We understand time
  constraints, so we will consider the requirement fulfilled even if the component is
  made in its simplest form.
- The card component UI currently has an image at the top and the text is at the
  bottom of the card. We would like you to flip this layout, while keeping all the
  card elements of the same height. See attached image for visual reference.
- Add type checks on components where you feel it’s required.

## Bonus Points

- Align the grid with the top navigation
- Fix the like button of the card
